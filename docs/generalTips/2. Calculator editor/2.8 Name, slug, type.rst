2.8 Name, slug, type
========================================

2.8.1 Name
------------------------

Not only is the name shown in BB, but also on the public-facing website, as the link text under a calculator. Here are the formatting rules:

* DON'T use the word "calculator". (If it's a converter, use the word "converter", though.)
* DO capitalize the first word.
* DON'T capitalize other words (unless they're "naturally" capitalized).

*Examples of good names:* BMI, Length converter, Acceleration, Ideal transformer

*Examples of bad names:* bmi calculator, Ideal Transformer Calculator

2.8.2 Slug
----------------------------

* DO use only lowercase letters.
* DO use hyphens between words.
* DON'T use underscore or spaces between words.
* DON'T use the word "calculator".
* DO try to keep the slug as short as possible.

*Examples of good slugs:* sphere, roi, sodium-correction

*Examples of bad slugs:* spherevolumecalculator, Return_on_Equity, sodium-correction-for-hyper-and-hyponatremia
