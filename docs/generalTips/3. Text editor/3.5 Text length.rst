2.3 Text length
==================

The rules for choosing the length of a text:

1. Look at TOP 3 results in Google for your main phrase and see how long their texts are. As a rule of thumb, it's good to have a text longer than each of these. Example: the competition wrote 300 words, 0 words, and 900 words, then aim for 1100-1200 words in your text.
2. Absolute minimum is ~500 words.
3. Make sure to write enough to explain the topic, explain how the calculator works, include the keywords in necessary saturation, etc. (but I think you know that :P)
4. Don't go crazy if the SEO potential is low (e.g. when we have only 1000 searches a month, it makes no sense to bleed out a 2k+ text).
5. The only case when you really should exceed 2k words is if the main phrase is really searched for (let's say, 10k+), and our competition has long, high-quality texts.
